# My Spark Journey

Welcome to my Spark Journey repository! This repo documents my learning experience at SPARK Academy, where I explored the fundamentals of AI and its applications in medical imaging.

## About SPARK Academy
SPARK Academy focuses on empowering aspiring AI enthusiasts by providing hands-on projects and insights into AI-driven medical technologies. My journey here has been transformative, enhancing my coding skills and understanding of artificial intelligence.

## Projects Overview
Each project represents a new milestone in my learning path. Here’s a glimpse of what I worked on:

### Week 1: Introduction to Python
- Explored Python basics: variables, data types, loops, and conditionals.
- Practiced writing simple functions and understanding code logic.
- [View Project](./week-1-intro-to-python-team-nigeria-lagos-ii)

### Week 2: Python Assignments
- Built on Week 1 knowledge to solve more complex coding challenges.
- Applied concepts like list comprehension, error handling, and file manipulation.
- [View Project](./week-2-python-assignment-team-nigeria-lagos-ii)

### Week 3: Advanced Python Concepts
- Introduced to object-oriented programming (OOP).
- Worked on modular code design and learned about Python libraries.
